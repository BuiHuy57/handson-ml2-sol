    "## Exercise Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Machine Learning is a way for machines to learn certain complex tasks such as regression and classification to predict values through algorithms and training algorithms. <strong>(Machine Learning is about building systems that can learn from data. Learning means getting better at some task, given some performance measure.)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "2. Classification problems, predicting values, computer vision and language processing. <strong>(Machine Learning is great for complex problems for which we have no algorithmic solution, to replaec long lists of hand-tuned rules, to build systems that adapt to fluctuating environments, and finally to help humans learn (e.g., data mining))</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "3. A labelled training set is a set which training instances that have labels associated with them. An example would be pictures with labels describing what the image is (an image of a bee with a label like \"Bee\"). <strong>(A labeled training set is a training set that contains the desired solution (a.k.a a label) for each instance.)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "4. Classification and Regression are the two most common supervised tasks.  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "5. Clustering, Anomaly (and novelty) Detection, Visualization and dimensionality reduction, and Association rule learning.  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "6. Reinforcement Learning would allow the robot to learn new terrains on its own.<strong>(Reinforcement Learning is likely to perform best if we want a robot to learn to walk in various unknown terrains, since this is typically the type of problem that Reinforcement Learning tackles. It might be possible to express the problem as a supervised or semisupervised learning problem, but it would be less natural.)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "7. Unsupervised clustering algorithms allow machines to learn this type of problem.  <strong>(If you don't know how to define the groups, then you can use a clustering algorithm (unsupervised learning) to segment your customers into clusters of similar customers. However, if you know what groups you would like to have, then you can feed many examples of each group to a classification algorithm (supervised learning), and it will classify all your customers into these groups)</strong>\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "8. It would be a supervised problem. This is a classification problem (classifying whether an email is spam or not), and thus will require labeled datasets which are supervised problems.  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "9. An online learning system is a system that learns in a live environment by constantly taking data from online databases and learning from that data. This keeps the system constantly up-to-date but requires constant training.<strong>(An online learning system can learn incrementally, as opposed to a batch learning system. This makes it capable of adapting rapidly to both changing data and autonomous systems, and of training on very large quantities of data)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "10. <strong>(Out of core algorithms can handle vast quantities of data that cannot fit in a computer's main memory. An out-of-core learning algorithm chops the data into mini-batches and uses online learning techniques to learn from these mini-batches)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "11. <strong>(An instance-based learning system learns the training data by heart; then, when given a new instance, it uses a similarity measure to find the most similar learned instances and uses them to make predictions.)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "12. <strong>(A model has one or more model parameters that determine what it will predict given a new instance (e.g., the slope of a linear model). A learning algorithm tries to find optimal values for these parameters such that the model generalizes well to new instances. A hyperparameter is a parameter of the learning algorithm itself, not of the model (e.g., the amount of regularization to apply).)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "13. <strong>(Model-based learning algorithms search for an optimal value for the model parameters such that the model will generalize well to new instances. We usually train such systems by minimizing a cost function that measure how bad the system is at making predictions on the training data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized. To make predictions, we feed the new instance's features into the model's prediction function, using the parameter values found by the learning algorithm.)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "14. Overfitting (machine fits training set too well and can't generalize for real-world problems). Underfitting (model doesn't fit training set well enough and thus can't make accurate predictions on test set or real world problems). <strong>(Some of the main challenges in Machine Learning are the lack of data, poor data quality, nonrepresentative data, uninformative features, excessively simple models that underfit the training data, and excessively complex models that overfit the data)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "15. Most likely the model is overfitting the training set, and therefore can't generalize to new training instances introduced in the real world. Three solutions are: \n",
    "    1. Regularize: Reduce certain hyperparameters in your model to help your model generalize to new instances.\n",
    "    2. Provide a more training instances to help your model generalize.\n",
    "    3. Try a new algorithm lol.  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "16. A test set is a set of training instances separate from your training set. The model doesn't train on this test set and is only exposed to it once the user is happy with the results from fitting the model to the training set. This is used for testing the model to see if its predictions are accurate.<strong>(A test set is used to estimate the generalization error that a model will make on new instances, before the model is put into production.)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "17. A validation set is a sort of intermediate step between the training set and the test set.<strong>(A validation set is used to compare models. It makes it possible to select the best model and tune the hyperparameters.)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "18. No clue <strong>(The train-dev set is used when there is a risk of mismatch between the training data and the data used in the validation and test datasets (which should always be as close as possible to the data used once the model is in production).)</strong>  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "19. You risk skewing the predictions in favour of overfitting the test set and thus worsening the performance of the model in real-world situations.\n"
